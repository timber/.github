We at Timber are dedicated to making the lives of WordPress developers easier by providing the Timber framework. Timber is PHP framework that simplifies the process of building WordPress themes. It enables you to separate the logic of your theme from the presentation layer (twig), making it easier to maintain and update your themes.

## Getting Started
Start by reading the [Getting Started](https://timber.github.io/docs/v2/getting-started/) guide in the Timber documentation. This guide will walk you through the process of installing Timber and setting up your first theme.

## Kickstart your theme development
If you're looking to get started quickly with developing your new theme, you can use the [Timber Starter Theme](https://github.com/timber/starter-theme).
